                        Static Assets
                    </h1>
                    <p> When it comes to security in general, you don't want the user to have the ability to access
                        every
                        single source file of your project. But there might still be extra files you want the user to be
                        able to download or view. Basically the user will be able to access a for example a certain
                        folder
                        using https. Typically you want to include images or styles to the static assets. Using express
                        this
                        can be done in the following way:</p>
                    <br>
                    <code class="codeDesign">$ app.use(express.static(__dirname + "/public/pages"));</code>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>Here i am stating that the folder "pages" in my root directory, followed by the path for pages,
                        should be
                        added as a static asset. Now i can load my styles to my html document, together with any images
                        or other content types that are part of my page.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="column is-half api-column">
                    <h1 class="column-title" style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #000000">
                        SSR
                    </h1>
                    <p>SSR stands for Server Side Rendering. What this means is that inside of the user's client having
                        to load everything when making a request, everything is preloaded on the server side. This is
                        handy for making sure everything is loaded correctly before displaying it to the user, but also
                        because of webcrawlers scouring the internet, these are the small bots that makes it possible
                        for valid search results to show up on for example google and adding server side rendering makes
                        your website more visible because of this. Implementing server side rendering using express is
                        not that complicated. First you want to import filesync: </p>
                    <br>
                    <code class="codeDesign">$ const fs = require("fs");</code>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>Once filesync is imported you can now read files from your project and convert them to a string
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <code class="codeDesign">$ const nav = fs
                            .readFileSync(__dirname + "/public/components/nav/nav.html")
                            .toString(); </code>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>Here i am reading my navbar file and converting it to string, i am then able to combine it with
                        other page components:</p>
                    <br>
                    <code class="codeDesign">$ let homePage = nav + home + footer; </code>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>Now i can return my combined homepage upon a request for the homepage:</p>
                    <br>
                    <code class="codeDesign">$ app.get("/", (req, res) => {
                            
                            res.send(homePage);
                          });
                    </code>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>And that's it, now you have pre-rendered everything on the server side before the user requests
                        the page</p>
                </div>
            </div>
    </section>
</body>
