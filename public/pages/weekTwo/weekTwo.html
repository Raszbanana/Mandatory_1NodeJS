            About functions
          </h1>
          <p>
            Important function types are:
          </p>
          <br>
          <code class="codeDesign">$ function AddArrowFunction(x,y) { return x+y } // Named</code>
          <br>
          <br>
          <code class="codeDesign">$ const addArrowFunction = function(x,y) { x+y; } // Anonymous </code>
          <br>
          <br>
          <code class="codeDesign">$ const addArrowFunction = (x,y) => { x+y;}  // Arrow or Lambda </code>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p></p> Assigning a variable to a function, still makes the function anonymous</p>
          <br>
          <h2 class="column-subtitle">Currying & Callbacks</h2>
          <p>
            Are two completely different technologies.
            Callbacks are essentially a synonym for "passing a function to a function"
            (i.e. higher-order function that consumes a function). In essense,
            currying is simply the act of returning a usable function in
            JavaScript instead of a primitive value like a Boolean or a string: </p>
          <br>
          <code class="codeDesign">$ function functionalThing(noun) {
                return phrase => console.log(`I am ${noun}, and ${phrase}.`);} // Currying</code>
          <br>

            Code Conventions, why?
          </h1>
          <p>Code conventions improve the readability of the software, allowing engineers to understand new code more
            quickly and thoroughly. If you ship your source code as a product, you need to make sure it is as well
            packaged and clean as any other product you create.</p>
          <p>Make sure you code always follows in line with the general convention of whatever you are programming.
            The general rule of thumbs for programming in general is:
          </p>
          <br>
          <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 200;">"lowerCamelCase when naming constants, variables, and
            functions. Use UpperCamelCase (capital first
            letter
            as well) when naming classes. This will help you to easily distinguish between plain variables/functions,
            and classes that require instantiation. Use descriptive names, but try to keep them short."</p>
          <br>
          <p>Conventions can basically range from file organization, indentation, comments, declarations, statements,
            white space, naming conventions, programming practices, programming principles, programming rules of thumb
            to
            architectural best practices, etc</p>

            Package.Json
          </h1>
          <p>The package.json file is a core element in the Node.js ecosystem and is basic for understanding and working
            with Node.js, NPM, modern JavaScript and JavaScript frameworks and libraries. The package.json is used as a
            manifest about applications, modules and packages. It's a tool to make modular and efficient applications.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>To keep things precise, it is in charge of keeping track of dependencies, scripts and configurations. If
            someone was to clone your project, he should be able to run NPM install, then node will look for the
            package.json file and know what to install, even to the extend of the version of said dependencies. Here is
            how my package.json file looks for this very project:</p>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img class="package-img" src="./images/tilMandatory.JPG" class="pckJson" alt="packageJsonData" />

            NodeJS with Express
          </h1>
          <p>Here is how you setup a simple and easy server instance, using express. Assuming you have already installed
            NPM you now need to install express:</p>
          <br>
          <code class="codeDesign">$ npm install express --save</code>
          <br></br>
          <p>Once this is done you can now create your app.js file and type in the following:</p>
          <br>
          <code class="codeDesign">$ const express = require("express");</code>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>This is basically how you import in node, using require instead. We are assigning the const express to the
            imported contents of the express module</p>
          <br>
          <p>Once this is done we need to assign our const "app" to the express() function. This is basically what
            instantiates a new express application</p>
          <br>
          <code class="codeDesign">$ const app = express();</code>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>Now that we have setup express, we can now start to use the built-in functions to take requests</p>
          <br>
          <code class="codeDesign">$ app.get('/', (req, res) => {
            res.send('Hello World!')
          })</code>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>However, since we didn't specify a port yet, we also need to assign that so that we know where to listen for requests</p>
          <br>
          <code class="codeDesign">$ app.listen(3000, (req, res) => {
            console.log("App listening on port 3000");
          });
          </code>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>Now when we navigate to "localhost:3000" We will be returned by a text that says hello world. Like this:</p>
          <br>
          <p style="text-align: center">"Hello World!"</p>
