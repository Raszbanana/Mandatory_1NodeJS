              Nodemon
            </h1>
            <p>
              What is Nodemon? As you might know, making changes in your project
              requires a restart before said changes will be visible. Manually
              this would mean having to type "node yourApp.js" repeatedly each
              time. This would be very frustrating when you are actively
              developing small changes in your project. However luckily there is
              a tool called Nodemon, which will actively listen for any changes
              in your project and restart your app everytime you make a change.
              To install Nodemon we use the npm installer:
            </p>
            <br />
            <code class="codeDesign">$ npm install -g nodemon </code>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              Notice that we also type in "-g" this means that we are installing
              nodemon globally so that we wont have to install it for every new
              project we create. Once Nodemon is installed you simply run your
              app using Nodemon instead:
            </p>
            <br />
            <code class="codeDesign">$ nodemon yourApp.js </code>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              If you want nodemon to not just restart on your app when changes
              are made to your app file, but also changes to html, css, files
              etc you then need to tell it to do so by creating a nodemon.json
              file in your root folder and type in something like this:
            </p>
            <br />
            <code class="codeDesign">{ "ext": "html, css" }</code>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              Nodemon will now actively listen for changes for the type of files you
              specify
            </p>

              Sending Data
            </h1>
            <p>
              Assuming that you have already setup a simple express server and
              can receive a get request through the web. Now you want to also be
              able to send data in a request. Using express this is very
              simplified. An example from a class excercise with beers:
            </p>
            <br />
            <code class="codeDesign"
              >$ app.post("/beers", (req, res) => {
            </code>
            <br />
            <code class="codeDesign">1. const beerToCreate = req.body; </code>
            <br />
            <code class="codeDesign">2. beerToCreate.id = beerIdCounter++; </code>
            <br />
            <code class="codeDesign">3. beers.push(beerToCreate);</code>
            <br />
            <code class="codeDesign">4. res.send({ data: beerToCreate }); </code>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              To explain in detail, we are creating a new const which will
              contain the properties of the request body(1.). We then assign the id
              to our global beerIdCounter(2.), to make sure that every beer added
              has a unique identifier. Once this is done we can now add the new
              beer to our array of beers(3.). We then send back the data of the
              newly created beer to confirm that it was created and added to our
              array(4.)
            </p>

              Loops
            </h1>
            <p>
              Working with loops in conventional java, we usually would do a
              typical for loop, which would increment to a set or x value.
              However this uses several lines of code. In javascript we have
              built-in function to handle whatever type of operation we might
              need to perform. For example purposes, lets assume we have an
              array of numbers:
            </p>
            <br />
            <code class="codeDesign">$ const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]; </code>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              If we wanted to increment or decrement every number, we would
              normally just write a for loop like the following:
            </p>
            <br />
            <code class="codeDesign"
              >$ for(let number of numbers){ number += 1; }</code
            >
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              However this can be simplified by using the "forEach" method,
              which all arrays in javascript has access to:
            </p>
            <br />
            <code class="codeDesign"
              >$ numbers.forEach(number => number++);
            </code>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              One thing to note however, is that the "forEach" method does not
              return anything, it merely executes whatever you tell it to
              execute on all the elements inside the array. Should you wish to
              iterate through an array AND return something, you should utilize
              the "map" function:
            </p>
            <br />
            <code class="codeDesign"
              >$ numbers.map(number => { number++ return number; });</code
            >
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              Lastly but also important we have the "filter" function. The
              filter() function creates a new array with all elements that pass
              the test implemented by the provided function. What this means is
              that it will return a new array which are the result of the
              parameters you set. For example if i wanted the array to only have
              numbers above 2:
            </p>
            <br />
            <code class="codeDesign"
              >$ const newNumbers = numbers.filter(number => number < 2);</code
            >
